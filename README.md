# WELCOME TO A PLANNED ONE DAY TRIP TO AUSTIN, TEXAS
Using a temperature dataset of four locations in Austin 2016-2017, this code calculates the best date to go for a customization temperature and the best path to visit 3 out of the 4 locations. My code is written in python since it is the only programming I know. Here my goal was to use some of the computer science concepts I recently learned, data structures and algorithms. I was able to implement a greedy algoorithm to calculate a path to take to the 3 locaitons using the data struccture called graphs. Although, my greedy algorithm is inefficient I still wanted to use to apply my newly learned knowledge.

## Run
To run this program, simply download all the files into a directory, go to the terminal in the directory just created, and use the latest version of python to run script.py.
